# UltimakerOriginalPlus_E3Dv6
Mount to mate an [E3D V6](http://wiki.e3d-online.com/wiki/E3D-v6_Documentation) to an [Ultimaker Original Plus](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Ultimaker-Original-Plus). This is based on the design from the [Prusa i3 MK2](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3/tree/MK2).

# How to print
Use a nozzle 0.4 mm or larger. Use a layer height 0.25 mm or thicker. This will help with bridging and ensure its a strong print. It'd probably be smart to print from a heat resistant material like [ColorFabb HT](http://colorfabb.com/co-polyesters/colorfabb-ht), but it has performed well with [E3D Edge](http://e3d-online.com/Edge).
